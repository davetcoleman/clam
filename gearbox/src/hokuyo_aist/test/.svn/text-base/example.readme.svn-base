Building
--------

The example can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the example's source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed GearBox into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir hokuyo_aist_example
$ cd hokuyo_aist_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/gearbox/hokuyo_aist/

Running
-------

The example requires that you specify suitable options for the underlying
flexiport object used to communicate with the laser scanner. At a minimum, a
type will be required. Other options, such as a baud rate, may also be
specified. For example:

./hokuyo_aist_example -o type=serial,device=/dev/ttyACM0,timeout=1 -b 19200

This will start the example, looking for the laser on port /dev/ttyACM0 and
using a timeout of one second, and connecting at a baud rate of 19200bps.

See the flexiport documentation for more details on available port types and
their options. Specify -h or -? to see a list of available options for the
example.

This example also comes with some log file pairs for use with the LogReaderPort
port type. Using a log file pair means the hardware (in this case, the laser
scanner) does not need to be present to execute the example. You can use the
log file pairs like this:

./hokuyo_aist_example -o type=logreader,file=example_urg04lx.log,timeout=1

See the LogReaderPort object documentation for more options that can be used
with log file pairs. See the LogWriterPort object documentation for details
on how to make your own log file pair for testing your programs.

The available log file pairs are:

example_urg_04lx.log(r,w): URG-04LX (Classic-URG)
example_utm_30lx.log(r,w): UTM-30LX (Top-URG)

Note for Windows users
----------------------

Because Windows lacks a readily-available implementation of getopt, command line
options are not available for the example on this platform. Hard-coded options
will be used instead; change them in the source file and recompile if you need
to change the port options.
